### Craftopia is a Minecraft server focused on high-performance and quality gameplay.

Enhanced survival with balanced plugins make playing with others more fun and enjoyable, with features like land claims, graves, temporary fly rewards, and a simple diamond economy.

Unlike most servers, our world will never reset. Build a base that will stand for the ages and explore what others have created.
